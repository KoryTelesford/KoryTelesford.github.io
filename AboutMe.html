    <h2> Who I am. </h2>
    
	<div class="Aboutmeinfo">
		<p> Hello, My name is Kory Telesford. I am a hobbyist computer programmer and an aspiring game developer. Programming has been a passion of mine since I created my first game written in C# on the Unity Game Engine at the age of 11, titled "shooter game", (lovely). It was a small test project to get my foot in the door that soon sparked a love for programming that grew stronger and stronger the more I experimented. Soon, I found an interest in electronics and wanted to experiment with it, so I made the bold move and disassembled my broken laptop to learn and see what was powering it(In hindsight I shouldn't have but I was bold). I watched tutorials from youtube, read many articles, and even consulted family members who were already skilled in the subject. </p>
		<p2> Today I am learning, seven programming languages, Database Development with SQL. I have a basic understanding of the insides of my computer, game consoles, and TV created one project in Ren'Py with python and three projects in Unreal Engine with blueprints. The train has already left the station its not stopping anytime soon. Outside of programming, you may catch me attempting to draw illustrations or animate using the Blender 3D modelling software. </p2>
